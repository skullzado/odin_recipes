  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour (sifted)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (sifted)</li>
    <li>6 tbsp annatto water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 pc onion chopped</li>
    <li>300 g longganisa (better if you'd use Laoag Longganisa)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>4 cups green papaya (shredded)</li>
    <li>4 pc small-sized eggs</li>
    <li>salt to season</li>
    <li>oil for deep-frying</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Make the Dough: In a large bowl, place both flours until well combined. Drain atsuete (annatto) seeds from
      water. Gradually add atsuete water and oil to the flour mixture, a tablespoon at a time to make a smooth and soft
      dough. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a pan over medium heat, place longganisa and add water. Let it boil for about 8-10 minutes or until cooked
      through. Remove from casing. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Pinch off about 3 tablespoons of dough. Roll into a ball. Place on top of baking paper and then with a rolling
      pin, roll out into a flat, thin round.</li>
    <li>Create a well at the of the dough, using a tablespoon each of the papaya and the longganisa. Careful not to
      break the soft dough. Crack an egg and slip in the well. Fold the dough over the filling to seal it all in. Cut
      off any excess dough. Slipp the empanada into the hot oil and deep fry until crispy. Drain on paper towels, and
      serve immediately with sukang Iloko.</li>
